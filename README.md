Project Title: 
Cornell Caching

Project Description: 
What is geocaching? 
Geocaching is a type of global treasure hunt of people looking for caches, or hidden stashes of objects. Geocaching may also be described as a series of hide-and-seek games, where hiders provide online clues for seekers. Seekers use global positioning system (GPS) devices to find hidden caches.
What distinguishes this app?
This app is a geocaching app limited to Cornell’s campus. It gives students an incentive to explore Cornell’s beautiful campus. Alongside the individual caches that users can hide/find, we could also create task lists (like a scavenger hunt) that students can complete as well.
